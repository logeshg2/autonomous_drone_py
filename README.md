# Autonomous Drone Project

This project is developed for Aerothon 2023 finals where the task is to identify hotspots and target in the field and capture the images of the same. The object that is loaded to the drone is also dropped on the target.
The above script is a example script that I have written for the competition. 

DroneKit python package is used to control the drone using python api and yolov8 algorithm is used to detect the hotspot and target images from the camera feed.

**Warning:** I have not checked the code on real hardware (i.e., real drone)
